# Python Test Samples

This portion of the repository contains code samples for testing serverless applications using Python. 

## Test Basic Patterns
|Project|Description|
---|---
|[Python Starter Project](./apigw-lambda)|This project contains introductory examples of Python tests written for AWS Lambda. This is the best place to start!|
|[Lambda local testing with Mocks](./lambda-mock)|This project contains unit tests for Lambda using mocks.|
|[Lambda Layers with Mocks](./apigw-lambda-layer)|This project contains unit tests for Lambda layers using mocks.|
|[API Gateway with Lambda and DynamoDB](./apigw-lambda-dynamodb)|This project contains unit and integration tests for a pattern using API Gateway, AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB.|
|[Schema and Contract Testing](./schema-and-contract-testing)|This project contains sample schema and contract tests for an event driven architecture.|

## Test API's
These projects have excellent in-depth examples of unit and integration tests for API based applications.

## Test Asynchronous Architectures
In a synchronous system, a calling service makes a request to a receiving service and then blocks, waiting for the receiver to complete the operation and return a result. In contrast, in an **asynchronous system**, a caller makes a request to a receiving system, which typically returns an immediate acknowledgement but then performs the requested operation at a later time. Asynchronous systems are frequently designed using event-driven architectures. These types of systems have several advantages including increased reliability, greater control over load processing, and improved scalability. However, testing these systems can present unique challenges.
