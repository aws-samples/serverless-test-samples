# What is EditorConfig?

# EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers
# working on the same project across various editors and IDEs. The EditorConfig
# project consists of a file format for defining coding styles and a collection
# of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the file format and adhere
# to defined styles. EditorConfig files are easily readable and they work nicely
# with version control systems.
